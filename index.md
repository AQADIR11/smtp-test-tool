# Free SMTP Test Tool â€“ Online Email Server Tester  

Email delivery is very important for every business these days. But sometimes emails fail due to incorrect SMTP server configuration. That is why it is important to do a simple **SMTP Test**.

## SMTP Test Kya Hota Hai?  
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to send emails. When we **test SMTP**, we check that:  

- Is the server giving the correct response or not?
- Whether ports (25, 465, 587) are open or not
- Authentication (username/password) is correct or not  
- SSL/TLS encryption properly configured or not

## Common SMTP Issues  
1. **Authentication Failed** â†’ Wrong username or password  
2. **Port Blocked** â†’ If ISP has blocked port 25, then make it 587
3. **SSL/TLS Error** â†’ Certificate invalid or expired  
4. **Timeout** â†’ Server is down or firewall is blocking
